node.js application to display Youtube statistics of A.R. Rahman songs


I am an ardent fan of A.R. Rahman. I was interested to see which of songs are most played and most liked based on YouTube.
Since music companies are now officially releasing songs on Youtube, it has become a popular destination for online listeners.
While Youtube data may not reflect everything, it is still a good indicator to see people's preferences.

This dashboard is created with stats from Youtube API and deriving trends realtime...
I have picked up 'OK Kanmani' as a pilot. This was released in April 2015.

Youtube analytics provides good amount of data to video uploaders. But some more questions to consider ...

    At which hours are more views happening ? Should advertisers be charged more during this time ?
    Which song is likely to get purchased digitally ?
    But more importantly for me, which A.R. Rahman songs are liked the most ?

The portal is built with node.Js, Express, EJS and MongoDB with Twitter Bootstrap.
